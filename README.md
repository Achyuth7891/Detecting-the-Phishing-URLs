# Detecting-the-Phishing-URLs
<h1>Detection of Phishing URLs</h1>
Detecting the Phishing URLs using Machine Learning , python.
Now days there a many fake urls which may steel the personal information by creating same UI(user interface) as orginal to detect those we use the ML algorithms to train and test the data to the alogrithm, we check the URLs to detect orginal or phishing sites.
<br>
<h5>Datasets:-</h5><br>
<p>Datasets are collected by kaggele and Phishtank</p>
<p>In above project dataset are contained in zip file you can unzip and use it or else you can add your own datasets which contains updated URLs</p><br>
<h4>Tools:-</h4><br>
<ul>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>VS code</li>
<li>python3 or above verion</li>
<li>Machine Learning Algorithms</li>
</ul><br>
<p>If any module is missing use "pip install <missed module name>" </p>
<h3>Procedure for executing</h3><br>
<p>First clone the repo {git clone https://github.com/Achyuth7891/Detecting-the-Phishing-URLs.git} or else directly you can download zip file Extract zip file <p><br>
<p>Now you can see the ipynb file run that and you can also see the app.py which is our index file for GUI </p>
<h6>Note:- Any module missing install using pip </h6>
<p>Now to run the app.py we need streamlit frame work you can install pip install streamlit<br>
Now run the app.py using streamlit run appy.py in terminal </p>
